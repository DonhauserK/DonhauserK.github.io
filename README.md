# Welcome
My name is Konstantin Donhauser and I am a first year PhD student at the ETH Zurich AI center suppervised by Fanny Yang and co-supervised by Afonso Bandeira. 
I have a Masters and Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelors degree in Mathematics all from the ETH.<br/>

My research focus can be broadly summarized as anything related to the **theoretical aspects of machine learning**. In particular, I have recently worked on topics related to **high dimensional statistics**,**interpolation theory** and **adversarial robustness**.
