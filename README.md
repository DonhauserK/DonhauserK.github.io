# Welcome
My name is Konstantin Donhauser and I am a researcher in statistical machine learning. My research focus can be broadly summarized as anything related to the **theoretical aspects of machine learning**. In particular, I have recently worked on topics related to **high dimensional statistics** and **interpolation theory**.
