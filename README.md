# Welcome
My name is Konstantin Donhauser and I am a researcher in statistical machine learning. \newline

My research focus can be broadly summarized as anything related to the **theoretical aspects of machine learning**. In particular, I have recently worked on topics related to **high dimensional statistics**,**interpolation theory** and **adversarial robustness**.
